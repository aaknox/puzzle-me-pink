### About Puzzle Me Pink <a name="about"></a>
This puzzle game is dedicated in honor of my mother, Jacqueline K. Howell-Robinson, whose passion for challenges and love for puzzles ignited the spark that led to its creation and whose love for software development inspired me throughout my career. As players immerse themselves in this world of wonder, may they feel the connection to the person who sparked its creation â€“ a guardian angel guiding them through each delightful twist and turn.

With gratitude and love, I dedicate "Puzzle Me Pink" to the memory of "Jackie".
